Facebook Chat Online Alert Chrome Plugin

So are you looking at your Facebook "Online Friends" waiting for that one person to come on.?


Facebook Online Alert is a free and opensource plugin for Google Chrome which notifies
you when your Facebook friends come online or go offline by showing Desktop 
Notifications on the bottom right corner of your desktop even when your Facebook 
window / browser is minimized.Facebook Online Alert is very easy to install. 

Once this plugin is installed, it will start giving you real time update about 
your friends availability on chat.


I hope it will significantly improve your Facebook chat experience.

This plugin was developed just for Fun.
So you can blame the boring friday night.
